* ob-manool

Simple implementation to add support for [[https://github.com/rusini/manool][MANOOL
Programming language]] in org and org-babel.

** Setup:
- Clone and load ~./ob-manool.el~
- In your ~.emacs.d/init~ and add the following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(require 'ob-manool)

(org-babel-do-load-languages
 'org-babel-load-languages
 '((manool . t)))
#+end_src

So far it enables the user to test and execute MANOOL code inside org file.

** Test:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+BEGIN_SRC manool

{
 {extern "manool.org.18/std/0.6/all"}
 in Out.WriteLine["I got tested!!"]
}

,#+END_SRC
,: I got tested!!
#+END_SRC
